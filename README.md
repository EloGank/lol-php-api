# League of Legends PHP API

A RTMP API fully PHP for League of Legends.

Currently in development !

# How it works

* Get [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) by copy/paste this line on your shell (in the project root directory) `curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php`
* Install all dependancies : `php composer.phar install`
* Configure your username and password in `index.php` (and maybe the client version)
* Then : `php index.php`

# Note

Use a development account, and not your real live game account.
